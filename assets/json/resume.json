As a team member, I built a machine learning model using simple neural networks from scratch to detect underwater pipeline. After the pipeline was detected, we fused data from various types of sensors, exploiting the Kalman filtering technique to track the pipeline along its route.","highlights":["Machine learning","Object recognition and tracking"]},{"name":"City University of Hong Kong ","position":"Summer Research Internship","startDate":"2016-06","endDate":"2016-08","summary":"Study the application of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for extracting an author’s writing style.
